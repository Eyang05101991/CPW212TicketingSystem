# CPW 212 - Ticketing System
This project is for the Advanced .NET Course. It is a Windows Forms application with the goal of managing a large amount of tasks. The application lets users who do not have the technical experience necessary to fix their problems, submit their problems as tickets to those who do. A non technician user would log in to the application and be able to submit new tickets, and view the status of old tickets. A technician user would log in and have a lot more features at their disposal. Some of which are: completing tickets, searching tickets, assigning tickets, setting priorities and due dates, and more.

# Setup
Please build the project right after you clone it, and then using the Package Manager Console, run the "Update-Database" command.

# Default Login Info
